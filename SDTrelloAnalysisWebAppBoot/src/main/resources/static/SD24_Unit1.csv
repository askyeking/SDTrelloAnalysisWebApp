We discussed whether the methods should write to the screen or return a String. We landed on returning a String because maybe we want to use that String and put it on a website instead of just printing to the console.

Once we coded stubs for those methods, we made a new class with a different job. It had a Scanner (old-timey typewriter) and the W symbol in `main`. We then coded that to work, though we always got `null null` because our stubs didn't do anything. Then we fixed our stubs.

After getting a large number from `toCharArray()` I asked military people what time it was. They said 14:00. So if I wanted to impress them and said ""I'll see you at 27:00 hours"" what am I saying? How did you get that? Went around the clock twice to get the hours left... the remainder. What if I gave that clock 37 hands (or whatever amount we have in our array).

* What is the purpose of UML? (Communicating class design to other people - maybe they speak Ruby. Also, documentation.)
* What are the three parts of the diagram?
* 4 visibilities, and their symbols if you can
* Diagram for a simple class (one private field, one method)
* Add class Other, how would you add this to diagram? Two ways. (show has-a arrow)
* Discuss HAS-A and how it works with owning class's field

JUnit

* What is the purpose of JUnit (writing code to test code). Answers like refactoring code to make sure it still works.
* (Someone will mention TDD.) What is the key to TDD? (A failing test first).
* What is it actually doing? (Writing methods to call methods in your class and assert if they output what you expected.)",SKIP (black),,,0,,0,0,0,0,2019-10-16T14:03:09.832Z,5da7231a79a2d285ded2f89f,Day 10 - Tue 11/19,5da7231a79a2d285ded2f895,Unit1Schedule - SD24,false
